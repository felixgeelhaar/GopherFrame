2. **API design churn**: Community feedback loops, deprecation policies
3. **Arrow library complexity**: Deep expertise building, upstream contributions

### Organizational Risks
1. **Timeline slippage**: Flexible phase durations, ruthless prioritization
2. **Community adoption**: Early beta program, influencer engagement
3. **Maintenance burden**: Contributor onboarding, clear governance
